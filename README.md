## Customization üé®

This template is designed to be easily customized.

-   **Change Text & Content:** Open `index.html` in a text editor and modify the text within the HTML tags (`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, etc.).
-   **Update Colors:** Tailwind CSS uses utility classes. To change the primary color from `cyan` to something else (e.g., `indigo`), simply find and replace classes like `bg-cyan-500` with `bg-indigo-500`, `text-cyan-400` with `text-indigo-400`, etc., throughout the file.
-   **Replace Hero Image:** In the Hero Section, change the `background-image: url(...)` property to the URL of your desired image.
-   **Update Logo:** Modify the text in the `<header>` and `<footer>` sections where "CodeCove" is mentioned. You can also replace the text with an `<img>` tag for an image logo.
-   **Modify Icons:** The icons are inline SVGs. You can find free, high-quality SVGs from resources like [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) and replace the existing `<svg>` code.
